This is the INSTALL file.

Canistro is still in development phase, so for now there is only basic functionality.

* Requirements

Canistor is based on the php mysql micro framework therefore the requirements are the same:

gnu/linux
php 5.4
libmemcached 1.0.4
memcached 1.4.13
memcached extension 2.0.0-dev
apache httpd 2.4 (mod_rewrite)
mysql 5.1.57

* Quickstart:

bash <(wget -q -O - https://raw.github.com/renasboy/canistro/master/bin/install) DIRECTORY_TO_INSTALL

Where DIRECTORY_TO_INSTALL is the location where the application will be installed.

While installing I assume you are geek in order to follow what the install script is doing in case it fails.

Will work on making it bullet proof...

* Description of the steps to follow...
